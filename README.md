# Bitcoin Candle API

## About the project

This project consumes the Candles generated by the [Bitcoin Candle Generator](https://github.com/Andrew-2609/bitcoin-candle-generator) using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com).

The consumed Candles are stored in MongoDB, and are accessible by a GET endpoint with the `quantity` as parameter.

## Used techonologies

This project was made with `TypeScript`, and the application connects to a MongoDB **Docker** container using **docker-compose**.

The GET endpoint is provided by a Router configured with the [express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br) framework.

## How to run it

1. Firstly, install the project dependencies by running `yarn install`.
2. Secondly, you need to create a `.env` file. You can use the base `.env.example` file from the project root to know the environment variables required in this application and how they should look like.
3. Then, make sure the MongoDB *Docker container* is up and running. You can do this by simply running `docker-compose up`.
4. Also, make sure the **Bitcoin Candle Generator** project running too. You can clone it with the link provided in the first section.
5. Finally, you can start the application by running `yarn dev` in your console.

## How do I know if it worked?

Well, if you didn't get any error message, everything is pretty much ok. If the two projects are running as expected, you can see in the Generator the candles being... generated. And in this project, each candle consumed in the queue will appear as a message in the console.

You can access `localhost:3000/candles/:quantity` to check the latest added candles.
